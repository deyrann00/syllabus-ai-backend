"""Deterministic stand-in for the LLM (LLM_PROVIDER=fake), used by tests and GPU-less development.

It applies a few heuristics modelled on the prototype's sample review (criteria 1.2, 3.5, 4.3, 6.1, 6.4, 9.2)
and quotes real paragraphs, so evidence verification and the improve → re-check loop behave like production.
